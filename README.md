# Daniel Yu's Portfolio 📂
  *   [Decision Analysis](https://github.com/shoond/portfolio/blob/main/Decision%20Analysis%20using%20Microsoft%20Excel%20Solver.xlsx)
      * Using Microsoft Excel's "Solver" plugin I demonstrate five different business use cases. Solver plugin is a wonderful tool for applying linear algebra to business problems.
      * Case1: Calcuate potential cash flow over term duration on real estate development using constraints: savings interest, loan interest, cash on hand, and diversification.
      * Case2: Yes or No decision modelling based on natural resource constraints and manufacturing COGS.
      * Case3: Price optimization and gaurdbanding based on COGS.
      * Case4: Decision trees using Microsoft Excel plugin "TreePlan." Calculate probablistic return on investments based on capex, favorable or non-favorable outcomes at each decision point.
      * Case5: Project and operational planning using Oracle Crystalball. Factors in probabilistic lead times as a normal distribution to prioritize competing activities.
   
  * [TAE_Climate Change Analysis using OLS Regression](https://github.com/shoond/portfolio/blob/main/ClimateChange.ipynb)
    *   Simple linear regression to determine predicitve variables that contribute to ClimateChange as measured by Temperature changes between 1983 to 2008.
    *   Takeaways: There are certain factors that we can say with certainty contribute to increasing global temps, however with limited data we can only be probabilistic to roughly 50%.
        
  * [TAE_Detecting Wikipedia Vandalism using CART and Random Forest](https://github.com/shoond/portfolio/blob/main/TAE_Detecting%20Wikipedia%20Vandalism%20using%20CART%20and%20Random%20Forest.ipynb)
    *  Classification and Regresstion Tree, and Random Forest modelling to detect vandlaism on wikipedia.
    *  Takeaways: Supervised learning based on correlation between confirmed acts of vandalism and variables. Recall metric of ~60% insufficient for use case, need to explore more variables and data.
  
  *  [TAE_Fulton Fish Market Price Optimization using OLS and IV Regression](https://github.com/shoond/portfolio/blob/main/TAE_Fulton%20Fish%20Market%20Price%20Optimization%20using%20OLS%20and%20IV%20Regression.ipynb)
      *  Price Optimization using OLS and Instrument Variable Regression analysis on Fish Market data.
      * Takeaways: Based on Price-Demand elasticity data throughout the week, we can find optimal daily prices to maximize revenue.

  * [TAE_Mortgage Risk using Logit](https://github.com/shoond/portfolio/blob/main/LoanReplayments.ipynb)
    * Simple Logit to determine probability of loans defaulting or not depending on various factors such as type of loan, FICO score, interest rate, etc.
    * Takeaways: From an investor point of view, we can use to logit to determine which loans are favorable to lend based on risk aversity.
   
  * [TAE_Stock Performance using KMeans Cluster Analysis](https://github.com/shoond/portfolio/blob/main/TAE_Stock%20Performance%20using%20KMeans%20Cluster%20Analysis.ipynb)
    * KMeans Cluster analysis to track stock returns performance based on industry.
    * Takeaways: Proposal for diversified stock portfolio based simply on past performance can be made. In this instance, for highly risk-averse investor simply wanted to beat assumed inflation of 4% YOY.
