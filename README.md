  * [Climate Change](https://github.com/shoond/portfolio/blob/main/ClimateChange.ipynb)
    *   Simple linear regression to determine predicitve variables that contribute to ClimateChange as measured by Temperature changes between 1983 to 2008.
    *   Takeaways: There are certain factors that we can say with certainty contribute to increasing global temps, however with limited data we can only be probabilistic to roughly 50%.
   
  *   [Decision Analysis](https://github.com/shoond/portfolio/blob/main/Decision%20Analysis%20using%20Microsoft%20Excel%20Solver.xlsx)
      * Using Microsoft Excel's "Solver" plugin I demonstrate five different business use cases. Solver plugin is a wonderful tool for applying linear algebra to business problems.
      * Case1: Calcuate potential cash flow over term duration on real estate development using constraints: savings interest, loan interest, cash on hand, and diversification.
      * Case2: Yes or No decision modelling based on natural resource constraints and manufacturing COGS.
      * Case3: Price optimization and gaurdbanding based on COGS.
      * Case4: Decision trees using Microsoft Excel plugin "TreePlan." Calculate probablistic return on investments based on capex, favorable or non-favorable outcomes at each decision point.
      * Case5: Project and operational planning using Oracle Crystalball. Factors in probabilistic lead times as a normal distribution to prioritize competing activities.
  * [Intro Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/shoond/portfolio/blob/main/Intro_Data_Analysis_with_Python.ipynb)
    * Intro to pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and the infamous "Iris" dataset.
  * [Loan Repayments](https://github.com/shoond/portfolio/blob/main/LoanReplayments.ipynb)
    * Simple Logit to determine probability of loans defaulting or not depending on various factors such as type of loan, FICO score, interest rate, etc.
    * Takeaways: From an investor point of view, we can use to logit to determine which loans are favorable to lend based on risk aversity.
